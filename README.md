 # ‚≠ê Particle Filter Localization Project ‚≠ê

The Particle Filter Localization project is a C++ implementation of a particle filter algorithm used for robot localization in a grid-based environment. The particle filter estimates the robot's position by processing sensor measurements and updating a set of particles representing possible robot locations.

## üè∑Ô∏è Key Components

- **Particle Filter:** The core of the project, where particles are moved and updated based on sensor measurements and environment information.

- **Environment Grid:** The grid-based environment is initialized with alternating black and white squares. The robot's movement is tracked within this grid.

- **Sensor Model:** The `update` function adjusts particle weights based on sensor measurements and the environment's grid values.

- **File Handling:** Robot movements are read from a CSV file.

## üè∑Ô∏è How to Use
- **Clone the Repository**
- **Compile the Code & Run the Program**
- **Input Data**
